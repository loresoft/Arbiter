# Validation Behavior

A pipeline behavior that validates the entity model before processing the command.

## ValidateEntityModelCommandBehavior

The `ValidateEntityModelCommandBehavior` is a pipeline behavior that automatically validates the entity model before a command is processed. This ensures that any data submitted through commands meets the required validation rules and constraints defined for the entity. If validation fails, the command is not executed and validation errors are returned. By applying this behavior, you can enforce consistent validation across your application without duplicating validation logic in each command handler.
